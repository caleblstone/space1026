          Experimental Archive Space is an experimental archival documentation project for a DIY arts organization. <a href="https://space1026.com">Space 1026</a> is a 23-year old DIY artist collective and studio, event, and printmaking space in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. This web-based experimental archive collects: documentation images from the past two decades of events at Space 1026; an oral history of the collective; and generative zine-making software to produce digital and printable zines with photographs and interviews. The image database is assembled from liberated images from public and proprietary social media platforms and sites.
          <br><br>
          DIY organizations are volunteer-led, with limited resources. Gentrification, recession, and a pandemic have all impacted the collective. But Space has survived and even thrived. And over the years it&#39;s hosted innumerable exhibitions, artists, auctions, performances, comedy nights and dice crews.
          <br><br>
          Documentation of the entirety of the unusual is impossible. There&#39;s just too much. Generated zines present a selection of gathered oral history from the current Space 1026 collective and collected photo documentation liberated from the Internet. No two generated zines will have the same content. The goal is to create something useful for the collective as well as the public both as history and what lessons can be learned about running a DIY arts collective.
          <br><br>
          Space 1026 is Al San Valentin, Andrew Jeffrey Wright, Angela Rio, Ben Woodward, Eileen Wolf Echikson, Jacob Marcinek, Jacqueline Quinn, James Bonney, June Armstrong, Lance Simmons, Maximillian Lawrence, Miriam Singer, Nate Harris, O. Roman Hasiuk, Rachel Gordon, Will Laren, Michael Gerkovich, Troy Taylor, David Rysk and more.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p class="introP">This zine was created with Experimental Archive Space, a web-based experimental archive for Space 1026, a 23-year old DIY artist collective and studio, event, and printmaking space in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. This zine presents a randomized selection of oral history interviews and images from more than 10,000 collected photos from members, Space&#39;s website, and scraped from web platforms.</p>

But Space has survived and even thrived. And over the years it&#39;s hosted innumerable exhibitions, artists, auctions, performances, comedy nights and dice crews.</p>
