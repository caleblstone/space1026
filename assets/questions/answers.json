And I had met Max the summer before at a residency that he was in at The Hacktory while I was at Public Workshop. And so then the next year or two later, I got the table saw. This fall I was like, oh, in the winter, I want to keep using this. I just I had no sense of what space 1026 was, or that Max had any involvement. And I just, I don't know why, but I texted Max. Do you know where I could find a studio space? And he was like, Yes I do. So I checked it out. And I was like, wow, this is like a place of my dreams. I've just totally  been immersed since then. And I think I have gotten the art bug back since then. Because I was looking to do carpentry projects and that kind of focus has waned in some ways. And now it's been more about more representational art making."

And we were at The Hacktory together at the Department of Making and Doing and I remember the day I met Max, and we were watching...he showed us some ski videos or something. Warehouse skiing videos! It was really dope. And then I showed him my art, and we just started that kind of rapport. And he introduced me me to Space 1026. And I was like, okay, and I've been there ever since. I did my senior internship there. And then when I got into college and came back from school in Maryland, I got a studio at the new space. And it's always been love, always. Great people."

I'm forgetting somebody. Joe France (?). Adam Wallacavage. Um....So I was roped into the Ponzi scheme by Ben Woodward who was from Philly. We were all in Rhode Island. And we were super inspired by Fort Thunder, Lightning Bolt, Shep Fairey. And kind of just weren't the best academic students in the eyes of our departments. And just kind of did our own thing. And when Ben was like, hey, do you want to move to Philly and build a halfpipe and live in a warehouse and and try to riff off of Fort Thunder? I was like, that'd be amazing. It's cool that we're not trying to do it in Providence because yeah, I mean like Fort Thunder and the other warehouses had really kind of their own vibe.

(Webmaster's note: 4 orgs including The Hacktory and Public Workshop collectively ran a physical space called The Department of Making and Doing. Sadly, it closed in 2015.). We were working on projects. I think my brother Phil was involved first, but Max took us to checkout Space. We attended and helped out in an art auction and got an idea of what it was about. And we've been helping out since. I haven't been doing much lately. COVID has meant that I've been home more but one of the recent projects I contributed to was the Art Museum selfie machine that I think James did a lot of work on it as well."

One of the things I had was a zine with the screen printed cover. He's like, oh, you're into screen printing. Where did you do this? I'm like, in my dorm room. He's like, why don't you contact the studio? So I did. And I talked to Ryan, who was organizing all kinds of projects at the time, and just sort of been involved, to some extent, ever since."

And it was like a really fun night. I met James and Charlie and James was really stoned. So he didn't talk to anybody.  And then a couple of weeks a week later I went to First Friday {art opening} at Space and it was more of a formal introduction. And I think Emelia Brintnall and Angela Rio were having a show, so I met them and it was really fun. And then I got to know James and showed him some art that I made after college and met more artists at Space and went to a couple meetings. And I've been a member since then. And during COVID a couple of us put together like a virtual shopping network that we streamed on Twitch. So that was like a fun way to engage with people through the pandemic and support artists."

And then I went to lots of things that Space 1026 did. I put in auction items pretty much every year since 2005, or something. My my husband Roland was a member in 1999. And then I moved in with Roland above Reload {messenger bag business}, and I actually started {an art exhibit} window in the storefront, and I showed James Ulmer and Chris Chau and then I also showed Mark Price's work. I was at the time at the Vox Populi building since 2007. I lived there. And then I moved up to the fourth floor with Jeff Stockbridge and I was in this teeny tiny studio with my screen printing exposure unit. And everything in a tiny studio and I was crowded. So Mark Price and Lance said why don't you move to space 1026? I was like, Great idea. So that's how I got there."

It's a place you can go and work and so I just started showing up with him a little bit and then he worked for Jeff Wiesner's Studio Abacus at the time. And so they had somebody move out so I just took the spot and, you know, for the first little bit I actually kept mostly to myself. I'm famously hard to get along with. Yeah. But, I just sort of got wrangled in to little projects because I could print and just sort of really organically came about that I became more and more of a participant. Myself and Mark Price became in charge of the print committee, and we managed all that stuff. With Orion that was the heyday where Space had a lot of activity doing a lot of shows nationally and internationally and, you know, all sorts of crazy stuff. "

It's just a feeling of like, you're not constantly wondering if the landlord is going to sell. Yeah, like who's that person that came through today?

          "response": "So fort Thunder was one of the most wonderful artists spaces I've ever experienced, super influential to me, and a lot of us who were there in the mid 90s in art school in Rhode Island. And at RISD there was a bunch of art school dropouts who'd moved into this 10,000 square foot space and literally built buildings inside of buildings inside of buildings. It was a labyrinth, a fire trap. It was terrifying. They're like kittens on the floor. And they're like people working at any time. And from my understanding, was that you could work whenever you wanted to, nobody can complain about the time of day it was because also everybody was living there. But they would do these amazing music shows. It was my first experience being exposed to noise shows and people strapping microphones under their neck and putting themselves in water and pooping on a mic like G.G. Allin or something, you know, they're willing to try anything. I don't know, there's just something about it that was really inspiring to all of us. Out of that grew Lightning Bolt and a bunch of noise bands came out of that. And ultimately as I've gotten older I've discovered that we're just part of a long line of tradition of artists spaces, before Lightning Bolt or in Fort Thunder, there was GWAR. GWAR had something down in Richmond, that was, we only think of the GWAR band where it's like a bunch of monsters bleeding and eating people and doing really inappropriate things. But before that, they were an arts community. And they would get everybody together and just build a bunch of like GWAR stuff, you know, and before them and before them. So you know, it's, it's a bit of a folk tradition of going from these spaces and just like Flux Factory, and Babycastles and the Salad Bar (Silent Barn). All these places are passed down. And it's changed too because of the internet. So yeah I was hoodwinked by Ben Woodward and Andrew Jeffrey Wright, but mostly Ben Woodward to come down here."

But you get like five years in, and people come in who aren't there {from} the beginning. And then it started to not run as smoothly. So, at that point, we started to be like, all right, we need to have monthly meetings, and monthly meeting still happen. And we need to have committees. We had all these committees just like we just at some point, it got so big. It went from its beginnings to having 30 people and outside screen printers. There was a time we would do 12 shows a year, then musical and performance events. So we did have to organize a bit.

I remember, the last meeting in person meeting space, and I was there. And then when I went to zoom, I don't think I've been to any. But information is relayed that way, like 'Oh so-and-so' at the Art Museum wants us to do a project this summer', or this or that. And then they talk about it in the meetings and there's group decisions. And depending on how flexible you're feeling depends on if you want to join in with all those group decisions, or if you're someone that waits for other people to make them and then come in when all the decisions are made. Sometimes it gets you know, it can get frustrating. 15 people trying to make a decision. So like, you just dip back and be like, okay, when the decisions are made, let me know and then I'll join in on the project and whatever you decide."

You know, like, it's not majority rule. It's, everyone understands why we're doing this and that makes it easier to go forward. And we had plenty of problems from the gate where it was just like I mean, the rules were no rules and And so you were allowed to do whatever you wanted. And, you know, we'd have like, certain individuals would want to, like, remake the bathroom, because their girlfriend didn't want to come to parties there because the toilet was gross. And the and the silk screen, like drained into it, you know, so they rebuilt the bathroom but didn't quite understand how to do it and, and then, you know, then poop is falling all over the poor people in the action aids office below us and you know, so it's so like it like that kind of like learning curve was there, you know, where we're like, Alright, look, there's no rules, but sometimes you have to be like, you can't do this without talking to everybody. And that, that built to that kind of like, like, whether we knew it or not built, like naturally built to that kind of Trumps game model of like, What's 30 people trying to get along in a building, or it's 50 people, or it's 25 people this month, you know, but like, we all have to get together and everyone's got to say their piece, and figure out how we're going to move forward. Because where we're at right now, it's just like, you know, six people are angry at each other, and everybody else can't get anything done, because those six people won't shut up about how angry they are. And that's annoying as fuck. So like, let's, let's hash it out. And those meetings would be retardedly. Long, like, just like, you know, three or four hours of two people arguing about whether blue was blue. And, you know, and you know, sometimes sometimes you have it, I mean, it's cool when it's cool, but it's also like, the actual nitty gritty of that, of that of humanity working itself out is, is, is a monster to observe.

          "name": "Roman",
          "response": "I mention something that sounds like an offhand anecdote, but it's actually really true: people stay as long as they do until they get burnt out. And you know, over 20 years of witnessing it, I I've kind of learned to accept it, I guess, in terms of conflict resolution. I think that it's. I mean, there's no HR, but it is kind of like a workplace. Because if you're in a workplace, and you you're in a giant company, and you work in I don't know, shipping and receiving and there's somebody in billing that's a dick and you don't get along, and it's just the way that works, well, you can't fire them, you can't do anything to them, you can't tell their boss that they're being like it, you know what I mean? So you basically just learn to, I've learned over my time of space to first, like, try to understand where persons coming from. A lot of conflict I think is miscommunication and poor assumption. And not to get too theoretical on it. But a lot of times, honestly, if somebody rubs too many people the wrong way, they generally, you know, there's no vetting process for anybody to join Space. And some people aren't a good match, just by the nature of many things. And so it's a lot of times, frankly, this problem solves itself. Other times, it requires I wouldn't say an intervention, but I would say, for the parties involved to actually on some level communicate, you know, and that really has to do with what the communication paradigms are for people. Some people can be passive aggressive for 10 years. And that's just their way of coping with stuff. And I wouldn't say it's wrong or right, but it's what it is. And certainly Max and other people that have been in the space a long time would know that there were times when people just wouldn't speak for years. And they somehow got over it over time."

So there was a lot of, for the lack of a better term, baggage in terms of a hierarchical sort of situation. And I think because there's been a lot of change in membership, that doesn't really exist in the same way. And I feel like I'm just excited for new members that are interested in not necessarily doing any particular thing, but just sort of buying into the concept of being and wanting to take part. So I guess that's a long winded way of saying conflicts usually solve themselves except when they don't. And, you know, it is what it is, I guess."

You know, sometimes majority rule and sometimes there's a lot of that, like, Who wants this? Raise your hand who wants that? Raise your hand. There'll be that a lot. But quite often, it's, most people are in agreement, you know, with most decisions, but sometimes there'll be just like, you know, artistic decisions, like, oh, who wants to make a chalk mural. This is just making stuff up like a chalk mural or who wants to do an interactive cardboard robot? You just decide, 'Oh, I like this. I like that.' Yeah, I think it's a lot of hand raising."

And so I worked closely with Max and a few other people to find our new location by going to a bunch of abandoned auto garages and warehouses up in North Philadelphia where people hung out.

          "name": "Roman",
          "response": "One really interesting and important thing has been the fact that to the best of my mind the space has never had a vetting policy for new members. And while that sounds like superfluous, it's actually like, you know, it's opened us up to have people that do music and printmaking and metal workers and painters and people who don't even touch art type stuff, and web people. And what I think that's led to inevitably is, while the physical place, especially at Arch Street was, you know, everybody had individual studios where they could go any time of day or night and make their stuff, I think, as a group, it allowed for this dynamic where, you know, a new person would come in, and they were really interested in, say, doing group shows. When I got brought in by Ryan, in the years afterwards, the space became much more outwardly focused. We were doing a lot more shows. There were big installs. And, you know, there were some people that didn't want to really participate. And that was cool. And they did their own stuff, but there was a group kind of, they kind of coalesced around that. But at a certain point, it kind of, you know, we did a lot of that stuff, and it took a lot of energy. And then some people kind of were like, okay, I, I've done all these shows, I want to go back to doing my own stuff. And so the dynamic of the group, because you don't know who's coming next, and you don't try to limit your options by like, bedding, or whatever else you'd want to call it, it sort of allows for this shift to occur, you know, if somebody is really interested about something they'll start doing it, and other people will get interested. And so an individual can move the dynamic. And so it's allowed for the space to go from like a very outward looking, or a very inward looking place to an outward looking place to a, something in between. And I think that sort of flexibility. And that sort of dynamism is what allows it to be something it allows us to change. And I think that in my opinion adds to the longevity. I guess if you're there long enough you realize, hey, it can always change. And so if I want to do all this stuff all I have to do is start doing it. And I can have really effectual input."

But that's different than just people coming in. There was a long period of time we had a low very turnover. And a group of people was always waiting to get {a studio}. It wasn't hard to find people. It was always a friend or past intern or a friend of a friend, someone who was vouched for. That, you know, it almost always worked out. But occasionally there was like, Oh, this person is moving from the Midwest and all this past member says is that they're a solid, good person. They were a nice person. But they're also a little bit of a monster, you know, but I had this policy, I was like, Look, we don't kick anyone out of the space. That's one of the rules. We don't kick people out. We'll just have to wait till they leave. Yeah, I don't know. I just wasn't like into like, We're kicking you out. I don't know, I'm not heavy handed. Almost no one was ever. And then what it came down to, do we think this person will pay the rent? And then someone already in the space knows them or thinks there would be a good fit. There was no portfolio review. There was no art review. There was nothing like that. It was just like, we just hope what people saw on the outside of the space and what they perceive the space to be if they wanted to join would be something that they would fit in with, and to a certain degree, there was lots of different types of art coming out of the space.

So I think what, what, with everything that's going on, but um, I guess it functions like Menudo {Puerto Rican boy band with Ricky Martin} did back in like the 80s. And that's what I mean, it's a community. We're only as strong as a constant flow in and out of coming in, and people come in and out. I guess an institution would suggest more stability than what we actually have. You know, we would hate to say that we have a manifesto because we don't really. Each new person comes with their own definitions of what it's going to be. Twenty-two years ago to have a community relationship with trans and queer {community} wouldn't even crossed our minds. Our first non binary members were probably four or five years in, but meaning that that wasn't, that wasn't a central point. But now, the new generations that have come in this is big: equality.

          "response": "Space 1026 wasn't necessarily meant to last more than a year. When we signed the lease in the beginning, some of us were apprehensive to sign a two year lease. I was like, I don't know what I'm doing in two years, can we get it for one year?! So I think one of the things about Space 1026 that makes it different is that it's just a space in a community. So much of it was just natural fit, you know. Everything just naturally fit together. There wasn't a lot of forcing people together. No administration, and stuff like that, which some people can bristle at and become too controlling.... Bring people in who have this idea. We don't have to tell you to not be a jerk, we're just going to assume you're not going to be a jerk. If you're going to come and join a space with 25 people in it you do have the option of just sitting in your studio not really dealing with anybody. But there's plenty of studios around the city. You can get cheaper rent in a more distant warehouse from Center City, where you can be alone. So it was people who were okay with being with other people. But you know, over the years people would come in with ideas for this space. 'I want to turn it into this, I want to turn it to that.' And sometimes it would move a little in these different directions. Sometimes it wouldn't move quite in the direction you want it. It can be very frustrating. You would have to learn. You'd have to watch this. Is it Taoism or Buddhism? You've got to be like the reed. You got to blow with the wind and if you resist that you break. People have broken definitely at Space and you know, a lot of people are left with a lot of good memories of the space mixed in with bad memories because it's just so many people working together but at the same time there was just the idea. It's hard to explain why it's just kept going. But it had, I think, it has a lot to do with the looseness. Hmm. I think it has a lot to do with its amoebic form and, and non rigid structure....So yeah, we're in a new building. And the building has been purchased by two of the current members, which is really cool that we don't have to pay rent in a city that's quickly changing, and in five years get booted because they want to do whatever, you know, what do you mean? So we have a more permanent home? And yeah, I think it was an institution it's a I think it would become a real high chance of it becoming less interesting. or dying."

          "name": "Andrew",
          "response": "There was a lot of times like, it's trash day, if you're at the space, you take out the trash. But then it would turn out some people will be at the Space there every night from eight to eleven. Which means almost every week, I got to take out the trash. Yeah, there's a lot of times you know, one person will be taking the trash out, or, you know, there's this three hour period that someone doesn't take the trash out and you just look around, see who's at the space. And like, there was a lot of times there was groups just like eight people there helping take the trash out. Cleaning the bathroom would come down to who can stand the disgusting bathroom or not. If you're going to stand a disgusting bathroom, you don't clean it. But I like a lot of times if I had to do paperwork, you know, sit down. I'd go in there with bathroom cleaner. I'd clean everything. Sit down. One time someone said 'Andrew, the bathroom is always cleaner after you get out of it, then it was before you went in. It was disgusting.' But even that even that, it would still be gross in there to anybody. But it would smell nice. It was cleaner. So yeah, there's a lot of that. It's one of the things I learned kind of early on was like somebody would screen print, and then just leave a mess in the screen print area. I get frustrated. I go in and before I go to screen print, I had to clean someone up was someone else's mess. And I would get really aggravated and get angry. And then one day a friend was screen printing. And they had finished and they're like, all right, they get ready to leave. I'm like, 'Wait, you can't just leave. Look at the press. Look at all the stuff. The mess. You have tape on the table, this, that. It's a mess. You looked at a mess like oh yeah, I don't know. I don't really see it.' So then it finally hit me it's just like, not everybody sees the same thing. When I see a mess, someone else might not see a mess. So I just got to lighten up. Because I'm not going to change some twenty-five or thirty-five or fourty year old who was not viewing the world when it comes to cleanliness or not like dirty, but like leaving stuff lying around. I just have to accept that if I'm in a group with 18 to 30 people screenprinting and doing things not everyone's gonna be on the same level of cleanliness or straightening up. So a lot of times it would just be whoever that looks around like this and then they start cleaning. Yeah, I'm that somebody. So I would say some people would never clean, and other people who thought it was dirty would clean. That's the way that would work and you would have to as the cleaner be somebody who would clean stuff, you just have to be able to accept your lot in life. This is how I see things. Clean. I'm gonna clean it. So I feel that I'm laughing a lot, because this doesn't make any sense to get mad. Do you want to live your life being mad at certain friends that don't clean up after themselves? Or do you want to just get it done?"

          "response": "If it's a spot where they think that things are going to grow up to like 15 or 30 people, I would say, you have to learn how to compromise and relax. You got to know a lot about yourself on when you can sit back and let things happen. And when to step forward. And be prepared. Unless you have some mega funding, or you're from a rich family. Be prepared for years of just like, you know, the labor of love type of stuff. You're going to have to do that. It's going to be a labor of love for a while. That's one of the things about our space. It never was a profit making venture. So like the old spot, oh, the rent was whatever. Let's say it was $3,000 a month. Then you figure all the studios in. And make sure it's $3,000 a month. Also: You can sometimes hate ideas, but don't hate people, I guess is one thing."

It's it's not like 80s or 70s aesthetic of what it was that we were doing in the mid to late 90s. It's not Fugazi anymore. It's Rachael Ray, or something. Like, it's changed. So that that in and of itself isn't a draw necessarily. The idea of punk isn't necessarily punk anymore, now it's Blink182! Yeah, so yeah, no, it's changed, things have changed. Society changes, everything changes. So what we were doing 20 years ago, as 20 year olds to our early 30s. Twenty year olds and early 30 Kids today don't seem to be doing that. And it's fine. I guess we were somehow close to the idea, you know, the beatnik and the hippie? Like work? I'm allergic to that. Really, but then we were working 70 hours a week, but on our art, you know."
